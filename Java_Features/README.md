### **The Evolutionary Path**

* **The Java 8 Era:** Revolutionized **how we write code** (from loops to streams).
* **The Java 11 Era:** Revolutionized **how we connect** (modern HTTP) and **how we package** (modules).
* **The Java 17 Era:** Revolutionized **how we structure data** (Records and Sealed classes).
* **The Java 21 Era:** Revolutionized **how we scale** (Virtual Threads allowing millions of tasks).
* **The Java 25 Era:** Revolutionized **how we run** (Zero-warmup AOT and 20% lower memory footprint).

### **Which version should you use?**

* **Legacy Systems:** Many are still on **Java 8**, but it is increasingly difficult to secure and optimize for modern hardware.
* **Current Enterprise Standard:** Most companies are migrating to **Java 17** for the balance of modern syntax and mature stability.
* **High-Scale Cloud Apps:** New projects should start with **Java 21** to take advantage of Virtual Threads.
* **Cutting Edge / Serverless:** **Java 25** is the choice for anyone needing the absolute fastest startup times and the lowest memory costs in AWS Lambda or Docker environments.
